![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Release-v1.0.0-blue.svg) [![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visit%20Releases-Click%20Here-brightgreen)](https://github.com/KarthiiKSR/resilient-call-dr-system/releases)

## Overview

The **Resilient Call Disaster Recovery System** is a robust cloud architecture designed to ensure seamless automated failover for toll-free calls. Built on AWS services, this system prioritizes high availability and operational continuity, even during unexpected disruptions. By leveraging services such as **Route 53**, **Lambda**, **EC2**, and **SNS**, the system provides a reliable solution for businesses that depend on consistent communication.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Resilient Call DR System is designed to be both scalable and fault-tolerant. Below is a simplified diagram of the architecture:

![Architecture Diagram](https://example.com/path-to-your-architecture-diagram.png)

### Components

1. **Route 53**: AWS's scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service directs traffic and handles failover routing.
2. **Lambda**: Serverless computing service that runs code in response to events, ensuring quick responses during failover scenarios.
3. **EC2**: Virtual servers in the cloud that host applications and services, providing the necessary compute power.
4. **SNS**: Simple Notification Service that manages notifications and alerts, keeping stakeholders informed during outages.

## Features

- **Automated Failover**: Quickly reroutes calls to backup systems in case of a failure.
- **Cross-Region Disaster Recovery**: Ensures service availability across different geographical regions.
- **High Availability**: Redundant systems that minimize downtime and maintain service quality.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Deploy and manage infrastructure using code, allowing for easy updates and version control.
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of system health to ensure all components function correctly.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS**: Core cloud services including EC2, Lambda, Route 53, and SNS.
- **Terraform**: For Infrastructure as Code, allowing easy management of AWS resources.
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging AWS resources and applications.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD, automating the deployment process.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Resilient Call DR System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarthiiKSR/resilient-call-dr-system.git
   cd resilient-call-dr-system
   ```

2. **Install Terraform**:
   Ensure you have Terraform installed. You can download it from [Terraform's official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file:
   ```ini
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

4. **Deploy the Infrastructure**:
   Run the following commands to deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   Check the AWS console to verify that all resources have been created successfully.

6. **Download and Execute the Latest Release**:
   For the latest release, visit [Releases](https://github.com/KarthiiKSR/resilient-call-dr-system/releases) to download the necessary files and execute them.

## Usage

After setting up the system, you can use it as follows:

1. **Making Toll-Free Calls**:
   Use the configured phone numbers to make toll-free calls. The system will automatically handle any failover.

2. **Monitoring**:
   Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor system health and performance metrics. Set up alarms to get notified of any issues.

3. **Testing Failover**:
   Simulate a failure by stopping one of the EC2 instances. Observe how the system reroutes calls automatically.

## Monitoring and Health Checks

Monitoring is critical for ensuring high availability. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

1. **CloudWatch Alarms**:
   Create CloudWatch alarms for key metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.

2. **Health Checks**:
   Implement health checks using Route 53 to monitor the status of your endpoints. Configure Route 53 to reroute traffic if a health check fails.

3. **Logging**:
   Use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs to maintain logs of API calls and system events.
